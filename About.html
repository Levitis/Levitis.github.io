            Welcome to my blog! I'm Levitis Lorenzo Burke-Astorino, and I'm excited to share my journey with you—a journey shaped by my unique upbringing, diverse experiences, and my passion for technology, finance, and sports.
            <br>
            <br>
            Born as an only child to two fully deaf parents—my father, an Italian immigrant, and my mother, a second-generation Jamaican—I grew up in the vibrant communities of South London, moving from Brixton to Croydon. My early life was a blend of rich cultural influences and challenges that instilled in me a strong sense of determination and resilience.
            <br>
            <br>
            My passion for technology began in childhood, with a dream of becoming a game developer. Though I initially pursued a career in finance, gaining significant experience such as managing a £600 million fund during my internship at Octopus Energy, my love for tech remained strong. This passion has led me to the exciting field of FinTech, where I aim to blend my financial expertise with innovative technology.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sports have also played a pivotal role in my life. I played rugby for Harlequins until the age of 16 before switching to American football, where I was selected for the Team GB under-19 squad and won two national championships while captaining the London Blitz. Today, I continue to pursue my love for the sport as a Safety for the University of Nottingham's first team.
            <br>
            <br>
            Through this blog, I share insights from my journey across finance, technology, and sports. Join me as I explore the intersection of these fields and how they shape the world we live in.
